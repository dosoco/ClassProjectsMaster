In this assignment, you'll create a simple web page built with HTML that displays information about yourself.

### Instructions

1. Start by creating a new repository
2. In your own repo, create a new html file, which should contain:
    * A title (your name)
    * At least one picture
    * At least one link (this could be to your GitHub page, your LinkedIn, or whatever you want)
    * At least one bullet point list
    * At least one numbered list
1. Once you've added all of the previous elements, read through use google to figure out how to change the tab title on your page and add one additional element type(again, looking at w3 or MDN) not previously listed
1. Once you're done with this, adjust the settings of your repository to enable GitHub Pages. This should provide you a URL at which your project is hosted.
2. Update the "About" section of your repository so that your project's "website" is the GitHub Pages URL
3. Finally, turn in a link to your repository on Google Classroom
